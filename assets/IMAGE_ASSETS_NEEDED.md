- Ensure proper licensing for commercial use

### Option 2: Generate with AI

- Create tech-themed images matching the product descriptions

### Option 3: Create Placeholders
- Use placeholder services like placeholder.com
- Example: https://via.placeholder.com/800x600/00e0ff/07070a?text=Product

### Option 4: Use SVG Placeholders (temporary)
For development, you can use inline SVG data URIs in the code.
